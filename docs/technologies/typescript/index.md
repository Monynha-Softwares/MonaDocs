## Description

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. It helps catch errors earlier and improves code readability and maintainability.

## Why we use it

- Better maintainability
- Compile-time error detection
- Improved IDE and editor support (autocompletion, refactorings)

## Projects that use TypeScript

- Monynha-com
- Several web projects in this repo

## Resources
