## How to propose a new project

1. Validate the business opportunity with the product team and document the target personas.
2. Create a discovery issue in the relevant repository describing scope, success metrics, and constraints.
3. Draft an architecture canvas covering tech stack, integrations, deployment strategy, and compliance considerations.
4. Prepare a delivery roadmap with milestones, resourcing needs, and QA checkpoints.
5. Submit the documentation updates (including a new project page) through a pull request following the contribution guide.

## Keeping project pages up to date

- Update the status, roadmap, and release notes after every milestone.
- Link to design files, tracking dashboards, or public demos as they become available.
- Record known risks or open questions so new contributors can provide support quickly.
- Archive deprecated projects in an `/archive` folder with a clear rationale and sunset plan.

If a project is missing or outdated, please open an issue in the `MonaDocs` repository with the details you have.
