# Repositories (legacy)

> **Status**: Archived. Use the [interactive repositories page](/docs/repositories) for the live experience.

This file existed to avoid breaking links while the repositories page was migrated to an interactive MDX implementation. The modern page renders data client-side, supports filtering, and caches results from the GitHub API.

### When to keep this page

- You need a static fallback when scripting or PDF generation cannot execute client-side code.
- External partners still rely on the old `/docs/repositories/legacy` URL and cannot update immediately.

### When to remove it

- All known references to the legacy slug have been updated.
- Analytics show no hits for `/docs/repositories/legacy` in the past 90 days.

If you decide to delete this page, announce it in the release notes and update redirect rules accordingly.
