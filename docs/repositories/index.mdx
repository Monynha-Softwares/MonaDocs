# Repositories

This page lists repositories discovered from the GitHub user `marcelo-m7` and the organization `Monynha-Softwares`. The fetching is done entirely in the browser using the public GitHub REST API.

<Repositories user="marcelo-m7" org="Monynha-Softwares" />

Notes:

- Data is cached in `localStorage` for 6 hours to reduce requests and avoid hitting anonymous API rate limits.
- If you need higher rate limits, provide a GitHub personal access token, but do not embed secrets in client-side code.
