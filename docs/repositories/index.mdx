# Repositories

This page lists repositories published by the GitHub user `marcelo-m7` and the organisation `Monynha-Softwares`. The data is fetched client-side so it always reflects the latest public information.

## Filters and URL parameters

You can control the dataset through query parameters:

- `mode`: `user`, `org`, or `both` (default) to choose which GitHub accounts to load.
- `showForks`: `1`/`true` to include forks alongside source repositories.

Examples:

- `/docs/repositories?mode=user` — list only `marcelo-m7` repositories.
- `/docs/repositories?mode=org&showForks=1` — show organisational repositories including forks.

## Authentication and rate limits

The component uses the public GitHub REST API. Anonymous requests are limited to 60 per hour. When iterating on this page locally you can raise the limit by creating a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and providing it at runtime:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken npm run start
```

The token is read from `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` and never persisted in the browser. Do **not** commit secrets—document them in `.env.example` if new variables are required.

## Caching strategy

- Responses are cached in `localStorage` for six hours to reduce API calls.
- Cache keys include the selected `mode` and `showForks` values to avoid stale mixes.
- Use the “force refresh” button in the component (or clear local storage manually) after making repository changes that must appear immediately.

## Accessibility considerations

- All interactive controls meet WCAG AA contrast ratios and are reachable via keyboard.
- Loading states announce progress through `aria-live` regions.
- Repository cards expose headings, descriptions, and primary language details for screen-reader navigation.

export function RepositoryPageWrapper() {
  const params = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? new URLSearchParams(window.location.search) : new URLSearchParams('');
  const mode = params.get('mode') || 'both';
  const showForks = params.get('showForks') === '1' || params.get('showForks') === 'true';

  let user = 'marcelo-m7';
  let org = 'Monynha-Softwares';
  if (mode === 'org') user = null;
  if (mode === 'user') org = null;

  return <Repositories user={user} org={org} showForks={showForks} />;
}

<RepositoryPageWrapper />

## Troubleshooting

- If GitHub rate limits are reached, authenticate with a token or wait for the hourly window to reset.
- Check browser console logs for API errors; the component surfaces detailed messages for 4xx/5xx responses.
- When repositories are missing, confirm they are public and not archived.

For the legacy static list, see the [archived page](./index.md).
