The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that are portable, declarative, and suitable for modern cloud platforms. Originally described at https://12factor.net/ and summarized on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology, the twelve factors provide pragmatic guidance that applies to web apps, microservices, and even static/documentation sites that have runtime components.

This post highlights each factor and gives short notes on how it applies to documentation sites like MonaDocs and to small-to-medium engineering teams.

1. Codebase

   - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
   - MonaDocs follows this: the docs, site code, and components live in a single repository. Keep a clear branching strategy (we use `dev`/feature branches and `gh-pages` for deployment) and avoid mixing unrelated projects in the repo.

2. Dependencies

   - Declare and isolate dependencies.
   - Use `package.json` + lockfile (yarn) and avoid relying on global packages during build. Our Docusaurus site expects dependencies installed via `yarn`.

3. Config

   - Store config in the environment (env vars), not in code.
   - Examples: `USE_SSH` is used at deploy time. Keep secrets (tokens) out of the repo and use CI or environment injection when needed.

4. Backing services

   - Treat backing services (databases, caches, external APIs) as attached resources.
   - MonaDocs is mostly static, but client-side features (e.g., GitHub API calls in the `Repositories` component) must handle rate limits and be resilient when services are unavailable.

5. Build, release, run

   - Strictly separate build and run stages. `yarn build` produces static assets; `yarn serve` runs them.
   - Avoid embedding runtime-only code that executes during the build (e.g., `window` or `localStorage`) — guard such calls to keep the build portable.

6. Processes

   - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. For MonaDocs the built site is static files served by any static host; any server-side API should be stateless.

7. Port binding

   - Self-contained services expose ports. Docusaurus dev server exposes a port (3000) during development. For CI and production, the output is static and served by a host.

8. Concurrency

   - Scale out via process model (workers). Not typically necessary for static docs, but useful if adding dynamic build pipelines or preview services.

9. Disposability

   - Fast startup and graceful shutdown. Keep build/serve scripts simple so they can be used in CI and local dev.

10. Dev/prod parity

   - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. Use the same Node version (Node >= 20 recommended) and similar build flags to avoid surprises.

11. Logs

   - Treat logs as event streams. For static sites logs are generated by build systems and hosting platforms — structure them for debugging (CI output, netlify/build logs, or GitHub Actions logs when used).

12. Admin processes

   - Run one-off admin/maintenance tasks in an environment similar to production (same build image). For example, previews, link checkers, or broken-link scans should run with the same Node and dependency set.

Practical checklist for applying Twelve-Factor to MonaDocs

- Ensure `package.json` and lockfile are up-to-date; pin Node version in contributors' docs.
- Never access `window`, `document`, or `localStorage` outside of client-only hooks (`useEffect`) to keep `yarn build` reproducible.
- For features that rely on external APIs (GitHub), implement local caching (we use `localStorage` with TTL) and graceful UI for rate-limit or offline errors.
- Keep secrets out of the repo; use environment variables configured in CI for private deploys.
- Add a small `scripts/` folder for admin tasks (link-checker, screenshot generator) that run with the same Node environment.

If you'd like I can also add a short contributor checklist in the repository (e.g., `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`) that codifies a few of the practical checks above (Node version, build & serve verification, avoiding browser APIs at build time). Would you like that created now?
